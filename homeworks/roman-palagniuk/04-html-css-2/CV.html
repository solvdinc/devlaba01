                    <p>
                        So far I learned a lot as Developer during last year. Have a bit of experience working as team member, as well by myself.
                        Speaking about professional skills - I have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript. 
                        Familiar with Node.js and most popular back-end frameworks such as Express.js, Koa.js, Nest.js.
                        Done a couple basic CRUD APIs with each of them. Tested with Postman. Worked with MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases.
                        Familiar with React, Firebase. Trying to improve usage of Redux and Hooks, TypeScript.
                        Of course my knowledge is basic and need a lot of improvements, and I know it's not an easy path. But I seeing myself as
                        future full-stack developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        To the list of life acomplishments I would put  Masters degree at information security. Wide working experience in different
                        companies including abroad.
                        Also I'm persistent, careful, love to study and learn something new to me. Curious about modern technologies, electronics, software.
                        Like sports, also competitive and active rest.
