# Solvd Development Laba 2021

This repository contain all information about the lectures and serve as central repository to submit all your class works.

## Structure
You need to create a folder in the `homeworks` folder. The name should be `firstName-lastName`. E.g. for a developer Dmitry Mishin the name would be `dmitry-mishin`. Sub-folder should have the same name as a lecture name.

## Pull Requests
### Naming
Every branch in upstream must starts with a prefix that is based on user initials. For example, for a developer Dmitry Mishin prefix would be `dm-`. In case of prefix collisions in the future the common rule is to dive deeper into the last name, for example: `dmish-`.

### Reviews
Once PR is created you have to do the following things:

- Assign your mentor as a reviewer
- Ping the mentor about the PR ;)
